# Midterm Exam

See the schedule in the syllabus for the date of the midterm exam. The exam will occur remote/online, via Brightspace, during our regular class session time that day.

If you have a clarifying question during the exam, please ask on Slack in a direct message to me, not in our public channel. I'll be on Slack throughout the session to answer any such clarifying questions. Do not communicate with your classmates during the exam and do not reveal anything to your classmates (including when asking a question on Slack) that could hint at an exam question's solution: this would be an academic integrity violation.

A link to the exam will appear in "Activities > Quizzes" on Brightspace when our usual class time begins. You may take it from anywhere on campus or at home that you would like. Just make sure you have a good internet connection and a quiet environment to focus. Also consider planning a back-up location (public library, cafe, etc) in advance, just in case your internet connection has trouble during the exam. Good connectivity will be your own responsibility: the date/time of the exam will be the same for everyone and no individual adjustments will be made without an OSAS accommodation letter. If you do have an OSAS accommodation, make sure you have emailed the PDF accommodation letter to me (if you haven't already) by Sunday night at the latest for your accommodation to apply to the exam.

The exam is timed and you will have two hours to complete it. It is open book/open note. The exam will cover material from the beginning of the semester through this week.

A few people have asked about good study strategies. Refer to the announcement. Most importantly, relax and come to the exam well-rested. If you've been putting in the work all semester, you'll do fine.
