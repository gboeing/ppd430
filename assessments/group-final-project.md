# Final Project

See the schedule in the syllabus for all assignment due dates and expectations. Group exercises need only one submission per group, so nominate a single submitter to submit on behalf of the whole group. You will be graded on your adherence to *all* the instructions. Please read the instructions carefully.

The final project is a cumulative and applied group assignment that requires you to collectively use the skills you developed over the entire semester. You will develop an interesting question then answer it using the statistics, modeling, and visualization methods you have learned in this course.

## Instructions

Develop an urban question that interests your team.

Collect data from two or more different sources, including but not limited to: census bureau, local data portals, FTP servers, or directly from an organization.

Clean, organize, merge, and process the data using pandas/geopandas into a nice analyzable format.

Conduct a statistical analysis. This shall include, at a minimum, a set of descriptive statistics, some exploratory analysis, and a model, such as a multiple regression model.

Create 3 or more static data visualizations, such as scatter plots, bar charts, line graphs, etc.

Create 3 or more maps, including at least 1 choropleth map and 1 point map.

Write a narrative paper (illustrated with your data visualizations) telling the story of your analysis in 2500+ words (not including tables, figures, captions, or references). Incorporate the visualizations and analytical results into your narrative and write everything in paragraphs rather than bullet points. Organize the paper into five sections:

1. introduction (provide an overview of your entire project)
2. background (explain the context, prior work, and motivation leading to your question)
3. methods (explain your data and analyses such that a knowledgeable expert could independently reproduce your study's results without seeing your code)
4. results (lay out your findings and visuals)
5. discussion (circle back to your question and what your analysis tells you about it, what is the big picture and how are these findings useful)

At the top of the first page, include your names, the date, your project title, and the word count (not including tables, figures, captions, or references). At the end of the paper, describe each group member's contribution to this final project (one sentence each).

## Submission

Via Brightspace, submit a zip file containing the narrative paper (as PDF), your visualization and map image files, web maps (if any), and the Jupyter notebook(s) and data files used to complete this project. Make sure everything is runnable and reproducible. Submit a little early just to be safe around the deadline.

## Presentation

We will have final group presentations in-person in class. Each group will have 10 minutes to present. We will go in numerical group order, so be prepared when it is your group's turn. Remember the expectations we discussed in class: 1) each group member must take a turn speaking, 2) stick to your allotted time, 3) follow the general format of the final paper's sections (see the final project instructions for details), 4) don't overthink these presentations - they are not meant to be onerous, but rather your opportunity for a dry run and feedback before you turn in your final projects next week.

Choose one group member to sign into our class Zoom session and have your group's slides ready to go on their computer. When it's your group's turn to present, you will come up to the front of the classroom, share that computer's screen via Zoom, and give your talk. Practice your talk collectively a couple times in advance so it flows smoothly and adheres to the required time length, so we're not rushed.

Additionally, please sign into Slack at the beginning of class. During the other groups' presentations, you will be responsible for leaving feedback for that group on Slack: 1 thing you liked about their project/presentation and 1 piece of constructive criticism. Your participation as such contributes individually to your final presentation grade, which in turn is lumped into your final project grade.

Following your presentation, you will have a few days to incorporate any helpful feedback as needed and make any final changes to your project/paper before submission. Remember that you have permission to self-plagiarize your own prior group exercises from this course for the final project, since they are designed to be scaffolding exercises.
