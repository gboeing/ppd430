As mentioned a couple months ago: at the end of the semester, group members will assess one another with an anonymous peer review and this will help determine final grades. Please provide honest feedback as your responses will be kept private. As we cannot observe all of your group interactions and divisions of labor throughout the semester, we rely on these peer assessments to allocate final grades based on the group's anonymous consensus. Bear in mind: this does mean that the overall group assignment grade is not a perfect barometer of your own performance in the course, as your own final grade will shift up or down based on your own contributions to the group. And just a final reminder that per the syllabus, class attendance is expected and participation in the classroom (as well as group work) forms a substantial portion of your final grade. Final grades can shift as much as one letter grade based on your level of overall participation in the course (as this accounts for 10% of the final grade, per the syllabus).
