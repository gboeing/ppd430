## Preparatory Notes

See the schedule in the syllabus for all due dates and expectations.

Notetaking is a core life skill for active learning. Here we ask you to engage thoughtfully with the course material so you can come to class prepared to put it into practice. Notes should be submitted as a PDF file, 1-2 pages long, single-spaced, composed in 12-point Times New Roman font.

Rubric:
  - did you summarize the main sections of the pre-class prep materials?
  - did you restate in your own words the main points from each section of the prep materials?
  - did you following the formatting instructions?
