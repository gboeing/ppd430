# Strategies for effective learning in a university

Students typically enroll in a university for one of three reasons:

  1. most are in school because they want to learn
  2. some just want the degree for its economic benefits/social status
  3. others figure this is just what they're supposed to do next in life

This guide is for the students in the first group.

## The Strategy

Think of the university like a gym. You pay a gym membership fee to get access to the facilities and people inside. However, a gym membership doesn't automatically make you fit. Now you have to come to the gym and work out hard and effectively. Exercise science tells us the most effective strategies.

Similarly, your tuition gets you access to the university facilities and people inside. However, enrollment doesn't automatically make you learn anything or earn a degree. Now you have to come to class and study hard and effectively. Cognitive science tells us the most effective strategies.

University is a learning experience. It's not an endurance trial of intelligence, or abilities, or personal worth. It's a brief opportunity to learn through intensive hard work. A toxic but common misconception is that by paying tuition, a student becomes a *customer* of the professor: this implies that learning is something that passively happens to the student for which the professor is responsible. Instead, think of your professors as your *guides* to their fields of expertise. They provide guided instruction and practice that you cannot get elsewhere and you get to have your performance evaluated and vetted by an expert as you progress toward mastering the subject.

The rest is up to you. Like exercising, learning is hard. It's supposed to be hard. Cognitive science tells us that if we're not struggling, we're not learning. Students learn more when they struggle through solving a difficult puzzle rather than getting spoonfed its solution. Students learn more when they're given space to struggle with difficulty and make mistakes. Those errors aren't signs of failure, but are to be expected as you practice and grow. It's just like learning to ride a bicycle.

With that in mind, here are some evidence-based strategies for effective learning.

## Reading

Take notes when you read, and focus those notes on restating in your own words the author's main point in each section.

## Lectures

Take notes during the lecture, and focus those notes on restating in your own words the instructor's main point and description of why and how.

## Practice

Practice what you learned: write some code outside of class by using the in-class exercise prompts and the group assignments as a guide for what kinds of things to practice until you're comfortable with why and how they work.

## Group study

Use group study sessions to discuss and practice concepts and techniques we learned in class: the most effective way to learn something is to explain it to someone else.

## Time management

Remember that assignment due dates are final deadlines, not indicators of when you're supposed to work on them. Don't procrastinate until the last minute to complete assignments that you had several days to work on. In general, avoid working on assignments at all the day they're due.

Many of us have outside commitments. We have families. We play sports. We work part-time or full-time to put ourselves through school. If you decide to commit to university studies, make sure you don't overcommit your time. Students are expected to manage their schedules such that they can keep all of their commitments, including attending class. One of the most valuable skills you can learn is to say "no" to additional demands on your time. Your time at the university is your time to learn. You'll never have an opportunity like this again. You owe it to yourself to set aside the necessary time.
