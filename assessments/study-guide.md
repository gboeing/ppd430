# How to study: strategies for effective learning in a university

Students typically enroll in a university for one of three reasons:

  1. most are in school because they want to learn
  2. some just want the degree for its economic benefits/social status
  3. others figure this is just what they're supposed to do next in life

This guide is for the students in the first group.

## The Strategy

Think of the university like a gym. You pay a gym membership fee to get access to the facilities and people inside. However, a gym membership doesn't automatically make you fit. Now you have to come to the gym and work out hard and effectively. Exercise science tells us the most effective strategies.

Similarly, your tuition gets you access to the university facilities and people inside. However, enrollment doesn't automatically make you learn anything or earn a degree. Now you have to come to class and study hard and effectively. Cognitive science tells us the most effective strategies: check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPxSzxylRCI) and these [posters](https://www.learningscientists.org/posters) for a short summary.

University is a learning experience. It's not an endurance trial of intelligence, or abilities, or personal worth. It's a brief opportunity to learn through intensive hard work. A toxic but common misconception is that by paying tuition, a student becomes a *customer* of the professor: this implies that learning is something that passively happens to the student for which the professor is responsible. Instead, think of your professors as your *guides* to their fields of expertise. They provide guided instruction and practice that you cannot get elsewhere and you get to have your performance evaluated and critiqued by an expert as you progress toward mastering the subject. Even if a certain class session's material isn't relevant to your future goals, the skills you learn will be useful forever.

The rest is up to you. Like exercising, learning is hard. It's supposed to be hard. You learn more when you're given space to struggle with difficulty and make mistakes, rather than getting spoonfed solutions. If you struggle with course material, it doesn't mean that it's too hard or that you're not good enough. Your mistakes aren't signs of failure, but are *expected* as you practice and grow. It's just like learning how to ride a bike.

With that in mind, here are some evidence-based strategies for effective learning.

## Reading

Read more efficiently by reading more strategically. First, skim the chapter or paper and take note of the section headings, any bolded key terms, and core concepts singled out in examples or figures. Divide the reading into chunks, such as by sections. Not all sections have essential information. Skim some of them, but go slower with others. Highlight important passages and take notes as you read. Specifically focus those notes on briefly *restating in your own words* the author's main point or argument in each section. What new terms or concepts were introduced? Restate them in your own words, rather than copy/paste quoting.

## Lectures

Take notes during the lecture. Similar to reading, specifically focus those notes on restating in your own words the instructor's main point and description of why and how things work.

## Practice

Practice what you learned. For example, if it's a class with coding and stats, write some code outside of class by using the in-lecture exercise prompts, practice notebooks, and group assignments as a guide for what kinds of things to practice until you're comfortable with *why* and *how* they work. The best way to know you've reached that stage is if you can explain the *why* and *how* to someone else without referring to your notes.

## Group study

Use group study sessions to discuss and practice concepts and techniques we learned in class: the most effective way to learn something is to explain it to someone else.

## Learning styles

But what if I'm a visual learner? Or an auditory learner? How should I adjust my study strategy?

Good news: despite the popular appeal, there's no such thing as learning styles. The idea was scientifically [debunked](https://youtu.be/rhgwIhB58PA) long ago. They are merely preferences, and those preferences often derive from what feels like less effort. Yet the cognitive science of learning tells us that what takes the least effort is usually *less* effective.

## Time management

Many of us have outside commitments. We have families. We play sports. We work part-time or full-time to put ourselves through school. If you decide to commit to university studies, make sure you don't overcommit your time. Students are expected to manage their schedules such that they can keep all of their commitments, including attending class. One of the most valuable skills you can learn is to say "no" to additional demands on your schedule. Your time at the university is your time to learn. You'll never have an opportunity like this again and you owe it to yourself to set aside the necessary time.

Remember that assignment due dates are final deadlines, not indicators of when you're supposed to work on them. You are given several days (sometimes weeks) to complete assignments that take, at most, a few hours. Procrastinate at your own peril. Don't wait until the last minute to complete assignments that you had several days to work on. Cognitive science is clear that cramming is an ineffective learning strategy. In general, try to avoid working on assignments at all on the day they're due.

## What about AI?

Should I use AI to complete my homework?

Maybe! It depends on 1) your goals and 2) whether your usage complies with the course's academic integrity policy. Is your goal to learn? AI lets you avoid most of the effort, practice, critical thinking, and productive struggling that are necessary for learning new things. We benefit from doing hard things and from structured adversity. Until you do the hard things necessary to build those skills, you are relying on AI to think, to read, to write, and to code. If you are just the human assistant who feeds prompts into an AI that does the real work, you will be infinitely replaceable in the workplace. You serve AI, not vice-versa. If it doesn't take much effort, practice, critical thinking, or struggling... anyone could do it.

That said, I sincerely do not care if you use AI in your future professional life, if your job is to create a product or render a service regardless of the means. But at the university, that isn't your job. Your job is to learn. We don't ask you to complete homework because we want to read amazingly written papers. We ask you to complete homework because good things happen in your brain when you struggle through the process of difficult work. The product isn't important: only the process itself is. And if you use AI to skip the process, you're simply not doing what you came here to do---or getting what you paid for.

Remember our gym membership metaphor? Using AI is like paying a personal trainer to do sit-ups for you: at the end of the semester you won't have six-pack abs. Tuition is expensive! So what did you just pay for? You're not buying a diploma, you're paying for learning.

Then is AI ever good? Sure! A rule of thumb is that it helps you save time at things you've already struggled to become skillful at. As an example, when I code, I use AI to help me write [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) because they're tedious, complicated, and easy to get wrong. But I can only do this because I already know how to write and critique regular expressions (through much struggle and effort) and I understand how they work. I just use AI to save time. But I still have to hand check each AI result for accuracy, using my knowledge of how they work, because AI gets it wrong probably a third of the time. This critical thinking is essential, and only comes after mastering a topic.

## Some final college tips

Know the syllabus. It's your contract with the professor, and you'll be bound by its policies. Is attendance required? Can you submit assignments late? Can you skip the last day of class to start an early vacation? Know what you've agreed to by enrolling in the course. Check the syllabus before you ask a course-related question. Most of them are already answered there.

Understand academic dishonesty and the different kinds of plagiarism. If you'd feel uncomfortable openly explaining what you're doing coursework-wise to your professor, then it is likely some form of academic misconduct.

Follow the syllabus guidelines and where and how to ask course-related questions. Practice email etiquette. Check your university email daily and send all school-related emails from your university account. Write courteously. Be detailed and specific. You're much more likely to get a useful response if you make it easy for your recipient to respond quickly and precisely.

Back up important files on your computer. If it crashed right now, and everything were wiped, what would you lose? Your answer *should* be: "nothing." If it isn't, then you need better back-ups.

Start planning your exit. You won't be in school for long and you need to position yourself for what comes next. Network, talk to people, build relationships, be memorable, and make a positive impact on the lives around you.

Know the difference between *fault* and *responsibility*. Bad things happen in life: flat tires, illnesses, power outages, computer crashes. They are not your *fault*. But it is your *responsibility* to plan for them and still show up for class and submit things on time. Sometimes we don't meet all our responsibilities in life. It happens. If you lose points, remember that you're not being punished for being at *fault*. You're merely graded on outcomes and responsibilities met. We're training you for future professional success: "but it's not my fault" is simply irrelevant in outcome-oriented professional settings.
