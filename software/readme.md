# Course software

You need a laptop for this course, but all the required software is free and open-source.

## Google Colab

Make sure you have read Module 1's assigned readings. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gboeing/ppd430/blob/main) and ensure *you are signed into your USC account*, not your personal Google account. This will use your USC Google Drive for cloud file storage.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into software problems down the road, sign out of Google Colab, close all open programs on your computer, restart your computer, then try your task again. If the problem persists, follow the syllabus's instructions regarding "Questions and Assistance."

## Alternative software (optional)

*The following is entirely optional.* If you prefer not to use Colab and have prior experience with the Python data science ecosystem, you can run the course software locally on your own computer. Install git and uv, clone the repo, run uv sync, then run JupyterLab. Note that you will be responsible for your own troubleshooting, so if you don't know what you're doing, just use Colab as described above.
