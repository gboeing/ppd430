## Course Description

This course provides you with a cutting-edge toolkit for telling stories with urban data. Each week will focus on a single thematic learning module consisting of a lecture and a workshop. The former will introduce core concepts and methods for a specific skill and the latter allows the students to practice these skills together in class.

This course takes a computational social science approach to urban informatics. It uses Python and Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate coding and geospatial methods that students can reproduce and experiment with in real-time in the classroom. We start the semester with the fundamentals of coding, then move on to data wrangling and analysis, then on to the theory and practice of analytical visualization, web mapping, urban spatial analysis, and introductory spatial statistics. Building up core concepts in this way gives students some fundamental quick-wins before moving on to high-level informatics/analytics applications.

Each week, students will be expected to:

  - Complete and discuss all assigned readings
  - Attend the lecture
  - Participate in the workshop exercises following the lecture
  - Complete and submit any assignments

The course has no specific prerequisites, but students ideally have some prior experience with GIS and/or basic statistics. Coding itself will be taught from the ground-up. However, this course requires a lot of patience. It is by nature experimental and will require lots of trial-and-error, self-direction, practice, repetition, and experimentation on your part. Please note that this syllabus is a living document and may be updated by the instructor during the semester as needed.

## Learning Objectives

  - Basic coding in Python
  - Collect urban data from the web and APIs  
  - Explore, wrangle, clean, transform, and merge data
  - Visualize and map urban data
  - Conduct basic spatial statistical analyses

## Questions and Assistance

I am available if you need help throughout the semester and I am happy to answer your questions. By email, you should expect a reply typically within one working day. Office hours info is provided at the beginning of the syllabus. Given the nature of this course, I do expect a few things of you before you seek my assistance with code:

  1. Close all open programs, restart your computer, then try your task again
  2. Search google and stackoverflow for the topic/problem (for example, the name of the function you're struggling with or the error message you are seeing)
  3. Go back through the relevant lecture materials to look for any insights
  4. Go back through the assigned reading materials to look for any insights

If the above steps haven't solved your problem, shoot me an email (or drop by office hours) and include the following information:

  1. A detailed description of what you're trying to do, why, and how
  2. A [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) of your code so far
  3. What you've already tried to do to solve your problem and what you have learned from it (specifically, explain to me the results of steps 1-3 above, including relevant links from stackoverflow etc)

I do not ask for this to be pedantic. Rather, I need it to be able to help you solve your problem.

## Materials

Due to copyrights, course reading materials will be shared on blackboard for enrolled students to freely download. The course lectures assume you that have read the assigned readings prior to the class session and are now reasonably fluent in their contents and ready to discuss/debate them in class.

Coursework will be based on free open-source software like Anaconda Python, QGIS, Carto, Docker, Git.

## Assignments and Evaluation

Final grades will be assigned according to the following:

  - 50%: 5 assignments (10% each)
  - 40%: final project
  - 10%: active participation in the classroom and workshop

Assignments are due by 23:59 pacific time on their due date, to be submitted on blackboard. Late assignment submissions will be deducted 20% per day. Late final project submissions will not be accepted or graded.

Assignments will be graded on the following criteria: does your code fully run? Does it do what it's supposed to do the way it's supposed to do it? Is it well-commented and documented? Is your code clear, straightforward, and reasonably efficient?

## Academic Conduct and Support

### Students with Disabilities

Any student requesting academic accommodations based on a disability is required to register with Disability Services and Programs (DSP) each semester. A letter of verification for approved accommodations can be obtained from DSP. Please be sure the letter is delivered to the instructor as early in the semester as possible. Visit DSP's [web site](https://dsp.usc.edu/) for more details.

### Academic Integrity

USC seeks to maintain an optimal learning environment. General principles of academic honesty include the concept of respect for the intellectual property of others, the expectation that individual work will be submitted unless otherwise allowed by an instructor, and the obligations both to protect one's own academic work from misuse by others as well as to avoid using another's work as one's own. Plagiarism (presenting someone else's ideas or work as your own, either verbatim or recast in your own words) is a serious academic offense with serious consequences. This includes copying someone else's code. All students are expected to understand and abide by these principles. See the [student handbook](https://scampus.usc.edu) for more details.
