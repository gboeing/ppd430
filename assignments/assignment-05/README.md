# Assignment 5

Due Wed 27 Nov by 23:59 via Blackboard submission.

First, get your hands on a spatial data set. You can download one as a file, connect to an API to download data, or use some data set you're working with elsewhere in life. Whatever you'd like. But perhaps consider a data set that helps you move toward the final project. If necessary, you may use the same data set as in the previous assignment, but preferably choose a new one.

Create a new Jupyter notebook. Use geopandas to load your data set and clean/process it as needed. Using the techniques we learned in class, do the following:

  1. conduct a nonspatial inferential analysis (such as difference-in-means or estimate a population parameter from a sample)
  1. estimate a nonspatial regression model
  1. compute spatial diagnostics and estimate an appropriate spatial regression model

Each step above should be followed by a markdown cell that succinctly explains your analysis, why you set it up the way you did, and how you interpret its results.

Make sure your notebook runs from the top without any errors and that all the visuals/output can be seen inline (without me having to re-run it). Restart your kernel, run all cells, then save/submit your notebook and any necessary data files, zipped, via Blackboard.
