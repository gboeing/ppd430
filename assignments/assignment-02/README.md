# Assignment 2

Due Wed 02 Oct by 23:59 via Blackboard submission.

1. Create a new, clean Jupyter notebook to contain your submission. The first cell in your notebook should be a markdown cell containing a plain-English narrative of the a) logic you will need to code and b) how your development process corresponds to *Think Python* sections 4.8 and 6.2. Use this narrative to think through how you will tackle each piece of the assignment in straightforward language.
2. Download the rents.csv file and save it to your working directory (i.e., the same directory your notebook is in).
3. Using the rents.csv file and the pandas techniques we've learned:
   1. Clean the rent, bedrooms and sqft fields, rename each to a new name (your choice), and change each to a floating-point data type
   2. Calculate the mean, minimum, and maximum rent, bedrooms, and square footage
   3. Create a subset dataframe containing listings between $1,000 and $4,000, and excluding any listings with missing values for bedrooms or square footage
   4. Calculate the mean, minimum, and maximum rent, bedrooms, and square footage on this filtered subset
4. Conclude your notebook with another markdown cell, summarizing your calculated descriptive stats in a plain-language narrative.

Use comments to document all of your logic throughout the notebook. Make sure your entire notebook runs properly and without any errors. Click Kernel > Restart > Clear all outputs and restart. This clears your memory and re-initializes your notebook. Then click Cell > Run all and make sure everything behaves properly.

Submit your notebook file on Blackboard by its due date. Before submitting, confirm the following: does your code fully run? Does it do what it's supposed to do the way it's supposed to do it? Is it well-commented and documented? Is your code clear, straightforward, and reasonably efficient?
