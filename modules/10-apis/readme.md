# APIs

You'll need a Google API key to use the Google Maps Geocoding API and the Google Places API web services. These APIs require you to set up billing info, but we won't use them beyond the free threshold in class.

Complete the following steps before the class session:

  1. Go to the [Google API console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
  1. Sign in with your personal account (not a work or school Google account), create a new project for class, then click enable APIs.
  1. Enable the Google Maps Geocoding API and then the Google Places API.
  1. Go to billing and set up a credit card (you will not be billed for the usage in class, but these APIs require a card on file).
  1. Go to credentials, then create credentials > API key, then copy it.
  1. Download the file `keys-example.py` (in this folder) to your desktop, rename it to `keys.py`, open it in a text editor, and replace the example API key with the one you copied above.
